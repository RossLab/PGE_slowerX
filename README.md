Analyses directory contains annotated walkthrough-style code for Baird et al. "Faster adaptation but slower divergence of X chromosomes under PGE". Please see the methods section of the manuscript for more information, or contact Robert Baird (robert.baird@ed.ac.uk / rbaird@wi.mit.edu).

Tables directory contains the following:
- dN and dS for all species pairs
- pN and pS for _Bradysia coprophila_, _Lycoriella ingenua_ and _Mayetiola destructor_
- Per-gene alpha estimates for the above species (both original and estimates after removing low-frequency variants)
- Quantile-normalised gene expression counts
